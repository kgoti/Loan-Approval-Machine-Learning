# Loan-Approval-Machine-Learning
The "Loan Approval Prediction" project is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on various features and historical data. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide a valuable tool for financial institutions to streamline their loan approval process.
